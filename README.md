# sp-18-stock-and-portfolio-analysis

Abstract:

For my project I plan to make a algorithm capable of analyzing a particular investment and being able to decide whether to buy or sell
a investment in a portfolio. I plan to begin with analyzing equities and expand the program's capabilities to include bonds, currencies
and commodities if feasible. I would then like to establish baseline metrics based on 5-years of historical data including technical
ratios, high and low prices and moving averages. The program will then analyze a set of test data and I will vizualize and plot its output
to see the program's performance and try to create a consistently profitable algorithm. 

Depending on the progress of the above portion, I may also attempt to add functionality to the program to recieve user inputs for things
such as age, risk tolerance, and investment goals to produce suggested investments, however if time does not permit, I may not be able to
add this portion.
